# For Visitors
For those who came to the server from countries other than Japan

Hello, visitors!

This message was made for people who live outside of Japan or who do not have Japanese as their native language.

Please understand that this English is poor because I used a translator.

This server is operated for Japanese people who understand Japanese, or people who are interested in Japanese culture and the Japanese language.

We will not stop you from using a translator to communicate with others out of a strong desire to learn Japanese, but if you cannot speak Japanese, do not use a translator, and continue to speak in English, this server is not for you.

Please find another server.

Also, regarding Japanese, there are rules for the server, so please check them.<br>
If you are a human and do not follow the rules, you will be banned from connecting to the server.
